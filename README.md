# ReefNet Dataset Repository

Welcome to the ReefNet dataset repository. This repository is intended to host all the code and results related to the ReefNet project. At the moment, the dataset is the primary resource available.

## Dataset

The ReefNet dataset is a comprehensive collection of annotated coral images designed for training and evaluating machine learning models in the field of corals. The dataset includes annotations and images that aid in the classification and study of coral species across different geographic regions.

### Download the Dataset

The dataset is hosted on Hugging Face and Google Drive. You can access and download the dataset using the following links:

### Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

- `ReefNet_CN_annotations.csv` (714 MB)
  - Contains the annotations for the CoralNet data sources used in ReefNet.
  
- `ReefNet_RSG_annotations.csv` (2.42 MB)
  - Contains the annotations for the ReefNet dataset with genus and species-level labels.
  
- `ReefNet_RSG_images.zip` (1.21 GB)
  - This file contains the majority of the training and validation images. Due to its large size, it is hosted on Google Drive.
